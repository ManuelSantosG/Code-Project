% GAIO
%
% GAIO is a toolbox for the set oriented numerical analysis of
% dynamical systems. It provides data structures and algorithms
% for the computation of
%   - invariant sets (maximal invariant set, chain recurrent set,
%     periodic points, global attractor);
%   - invariant manifolds (stable/unstable manifold of an arbitrary
%     invariant set);
%   - invariant measures, almost invariant sets
%   - value functions for optimal control problems
%
% data structure
%   Tree         - basic data structure for storing the set collections
%
% functions
%   tpgraph      - transition probability graph
%   dpgraph      - dynamic programming graph
%   dijkstra     - shortest paths in a directed graph 
%   boxplot2/3   - box plot in 2D and 3D
